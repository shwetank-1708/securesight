          Video surveillance systems allow homeowners to monitor their property
          remotely via smartphones or computers. They can be indoor, outdoor, or
          a combination of both. Many home security companies offer professional
          installation services to ensure that all components are set up
          correctly and functioning properly. They also provide ongoing support
          and maintenance.
